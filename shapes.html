    <!--
        the width and height define the visible area (and its size) of your svg
            the visible area is calle the "viewport"
        viewbox, the first two values are positioning, like panning a telescope
            it defines the position of the viiewport overtop of the image
            viewbox="50 50 200 300" would start at 50 pixels into the image from the top and the left
        the second two values of the viewbox are like zooming
            viewbox="0 0 100 150" (half the size of the viewport of 200 x 300) would make the image
            appear twice as large, like zooming in
            viewbox="0 0 400 600" would make the image appear twice as small, like zooming out
